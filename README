Building a library for Windows

Dependencies

* Download and install GIT from https://git-scm.com in C:\Program Files\Git (should be the default).
* Download and install CMake https://cmake.org in C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake. 
You can put the 64 bit version in C:\Program Files\CMake, and then just copy it to C:\Program Files (x86).
* Installing cygwin
The installation must be done in the C:\cygwin (this is the default).
It is necessary to select flex, bison, bash packages for installation. 
The archive with the verified version can be downloaded at https://files.xisupport.com/libximc_dependencies/cygwin_ci.7z, 
then just unpack the archive on the C:\drive.
* Install JDK 64 bits if not installed. A proven Java distribution can be downloaded 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/javaclientmsiinstallers/files/Java%20JDK%209%20Update%20464/jdk9.0.464.zip/download
or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase9-archive-downloads.html. Authorization is required to download from the second link.
Prescribe the variable JDK_PATH
Example: JDK is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4 
=> Start -> PC Software Computer -> Properties -> Additional system parameters -> Environment Variables -> System variables,
there we create a variable JDK_HOME and JDK32_HOME with the value C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4
* It is necessary to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.

Working with the library

* Cloning the repository: 
  git clone https://github.com/EPC-MSU/libximc
* We switch to the desired state using git checkout
* From the library folder, run the: 
  build.bat
* The result of the assembly can be taken in \ximc
